# Bayesian-Classifier-Using-MATLAB

Abstract -- In this project we are performing an experiment with 1000 participants and two independent measurements (F1 and F2) are recorded while the participants performed 5 different tasks (𝐶1, 𝐶2, ⋯ 𝐶5). Here we are finding the best Classifier of this data by using Bayes theorem by following the steps: training, testing and calculating the accuracy of the classifier, calculating standard normal of F1 and F2, considering 4 cases(X=F1, X= Z1, X= F2 and X= [Z1; F2]) and comparing the classification rates of all the 4 cases.
